#Spring Boot Rest with java modules in embedded tomcat  
##Objective: launching spring boot rest applications with JPMS.

###Steps

A) Edit setenv.bat file.  

B) In command prompt launch the following.
1. build-regular.bat
2. run-regular.bat

Visit http://localhost:8080/greeting  
Also note the modules listed in console.  
Stop the server.  

C) In command prompt launch the following.  
1. build-modular.bat  
2. run-modular.bat  

Visit http://localhost:8080/greeting  
Also note the modules listed in console.  
Stop the server. 

D) Run ant build.xml to generate a verify/badjar.jar file.  
Its the same jar file as generated by  build-regular.bat.  
There is just a small difference-
module-info.class is almost empty.

Can launch this bad jar using run-badjar.bat  
Visit http://localhost:8080/greeting  
Also note the modules listed in console.  
Stop the server. 

Currently having only .bat files.
